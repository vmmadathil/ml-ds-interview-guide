Arrays, also known as Lists, are common data structures used to store elements of the same type. Arrays must be stored on consecutive bytes of memory, which is why we cannot just allocate more memory on demand to expand an array. A very fundamental data structure.

## Advantages
* Constant-time access to an index
* Space efficiency
* Memory locality


## Downsides
* Cannot adjust size in the middle of program execution easily

## Common Functions

In Python, arrays are referred to as lists.
