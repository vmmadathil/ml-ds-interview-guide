# SQL

One common problem *I* encounter with SQL is learning how to formulate effective queries. This is because the way a query is written isn't the proper way to think about it.

SQL Queries are not written in a way that makes a lot of intuitive sense:

## Writing Queries
* *Select*: Used to fetch data
* *From*: What table to fetch from
* *Join*: Joins tables based on conditions
* *Where*: Used to filter records by specific condition
* *Group By*: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows; often used with aggregate functions
* *Having*: Used instead of where for aggregate functions
* *Order By*: Used to sort the result in ascending or descending order
* *Limit*: Used to limit the number of records returned
* *Offset*: Used to skip a certain number of records returned

## Variables
Variables must be declared with the DECLARE statement and the data type. Value is optional.
```
DECLARE VARIABLE AS DATA_TYPE = VALUE
```
